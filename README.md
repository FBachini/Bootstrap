## Discord Bot for Node JS development improvement

This Bot has a living purpose, choose wisely the game for the friday night rest.

It is entirely built upon [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) lib.

The main functionalities are:
- Open Vote (Allow Repetition) - Selects one game
- Closed Vote (Do not Allow Repetition) - Selects one game

The fun functionalities are:
- Disconnect - Sends away from the voice channel your (annoying) friend
- Prefix - Be careful with complex prefixes!

To run the bot you need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed then just:

`sudo node index.js`

The name is not defined, and someday the bot can vote his own name, therefore, who chooses the [name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop)? The Developer or the Bot
